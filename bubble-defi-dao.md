# üè® Bubble DeFi DAO

:star: Bubble DeFi will be a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that is not based on any central authority. It will be a decentralized autonomous organization that will operate autonomously from the blockchain and other smart contracts.

:speaking\_head:Bubble DeFi DAO is created using a smart contract. This is a mechanism through which individuals can anonymously set up DAOs without having to rely on any centralized entity like a central bank or government.

:coin: To achieve that is to create a special type of collectively managed organization known as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and require participants to invest their own money in exchange for voting powers to ensure they all act honestly and the DAO prevails.

:book: The $BUB utility token known as a " Governance Token" is then issued to Bubble users to represent each person's stake in the DAO for voting and earning.
