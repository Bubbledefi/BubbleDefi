# üè® Bubble DeFi DAO

:star: Bubble DeFi is a revolutionary decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that operates autonomously through the use of blockchain technology and smart contracts, free from any central authority.

Our DAO is established using a smart contract, enabling individuals to set up and participate in anonymous, collectively-managed organizations without requiring any centralized entity, such as a central bank or government.

:speaking\_head:At Bubble DeFi, we understand the importance of ensuring that all participants act with honesty and transparency in order to preserve the integrity of our DAO. That's why we require users to invest their own capital in exchange for voting powers, which they can use to actively engage in the decision-making process of the DAO.

:coin: To represent each participant's stake in our DAO, we issue the $BUB utility token, which serves as a governance token for voting and earning rewards. Through the use of the $BUB governance token, users have the ability to shape the future of our DAO by contributing their opinions, ideas, and feedback to ensure our ecosystem remains sustainable and grows over time.
