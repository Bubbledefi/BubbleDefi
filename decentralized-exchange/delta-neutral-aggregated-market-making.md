# üíπ Delta Neutral Aggregated Market Making

:bookmark\_tabs:The Bubble DeFi protocol employs a sophisticated Delta Neutral Aggregated Market Making (DNAMM) approach, which hedges against the possibility of a liquidity crunch by imposing a 3% tax on every transaction.\
\
:link: The tax is directed towards liquidity, with 2% allocated to building up the liquidity reserve. This strategy enables the protocol to increase liquid allocations while mitigating the risk of unduly large positions that may result from a crowding effect.

:ocean: Our protocol uses an active strategy to exploit the negative impact of liquidity. It runs through all pools, including the selected pairs, to ensure users get the best price for their transactions. Unlike market-making bots that profit from trades, Bubble DeFi ensures that users receive the most optimal price by leveraging its multiple pools. This approach helps to create a more efficient and trustless environment for trading ERC20 tokens.
