# üíπ Delta Neutral Aggregated Market Making

:bookmark\_tabs:The BubbleDeFi smart contract was created with the intention to hedge for the possibility of a liquidity crunch taxing every transaction with 3% that goes straight into liquidity and 2% that builds up the liquidity reserve.&#x20;

:sweat\_drops: This allows the protocol to increase liquid allocations while aiming to avoid unduly large positions of crowding risk. Deploying an active strategy to exploit the negative impact of liquidity.

:ocean: Our protocol will run through all pools which include your selected pairs in order to get the best price for your transaction. Instead of market making bots profiting from your trades, you will get the most optimal price going through our different pools.
