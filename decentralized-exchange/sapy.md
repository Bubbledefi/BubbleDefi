:paperclips: In building our protocol we have looked for a responsible and sustainable way to build our protocol reward system. While also taking social and governance considerations into account when deciding on parameters of our product. Our goal leads us to getting more long-term sustainable economic activities and traction on our ecosystem.

:coin: Our protocol reward system for ecosystem users is purely based on fees generated on volume within liquidity pools. Therefore the rewards will be sustainable based on the fact that yield returns have direct correlation to protocol revenue. With synthetic yield making it possible for users to leverage up their (LP) position with a time lock while token holders can start to earn real yield directly by staking the native token.&#x20;

:potable\_water: Delta neutrality AMM is added in the native token contract by constant taxation of trader transaction creating a stable floor for price stability. This decreases token volatility with volume increase and creates demand based on volume for token through buy backs for LP.
