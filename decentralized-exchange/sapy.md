:paperclips: In designing our protocol, we have prioritized responsible and sustainable approaches to building our reward system. Social and governance considerations were key factors in deciding the parameters of our product, with a focus on fostering long-term sustainable economic activity within our ecosystem.

:moneybag:Our reward system is uniquely tied to the fees generated on the volume within our liquidity pools. This approach ensures that yield returns are directly proportional to the protocol revenue, which promotes sustainability. Additionally, the synthetic yield allows users to leverage their liquidity provider position and earn greater rewards through a time lock, while token holders can earn real yield by staking the native token.

:potable\_water: The Delta Neutral Aggregated Market Making (DNAMM) feature in the native token contract provides an added layer of stability through a constant taxation of trader transactions. This stable floor for price stability results in decreased token volatility with an increase in volume, creating demand for the token through buybacks for liquidity providers. Overall, our protocol offers a responsible, sustainable, and stable environment for users seeking to engage in DeFi and crypto protocols.\
