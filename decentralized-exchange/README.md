# âš– Decentralized Exchange

ðŸ”„ **Token Swaps**&#x20;

We are on a mission to make BubbleSwap the best place to get involved in the crypto market by offering our customers a safe and secure environment to trade their tokens without having to worry about the risks associated with other exchanges.\

ðŸŒŠ **Liquidity Pools**

BubbleSwap can only operate optimally when there's enough liquidity to support trades; if nobody wanted to sell you ETH for example, then it wouldn't matter how much you wanted to trade for some.

This is where liquidity providers come in. Providing liquidity will get you LP Tokens, which will earn you rewards in the form of trading fees for making sure there's always liquidity for the exchange to use.
