ðŸŒŠ **Liquidity Pools**

In the world of decentralized finance, liquidity is crucial for the seamless functioning of exchanges. Bubble Swap is no exception to this rule, and requires sufficient liquidity to ensure uninterrupted trading. However, given that there is no centralized entity backing the exchange, the question arises: where does this liquidity come from?

Enter liquidity providers, who play a critical role in the Bubble Swap ecosystem. By adding liquidity to the platform, providers earn LP tokens which entitle them to a portion of the trading fees generated by the platform.

This incentive mechanism ensures that there is always enough liquidity to support trades, as providers are incentivized to keep the platform well-stocked with the assets required for trading. As such, they play an integral role in the long-term sustainability and growth of the Bubble Swap ecosystem.
