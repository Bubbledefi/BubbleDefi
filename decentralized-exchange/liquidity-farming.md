# ðŸ’§ Liquidity Farming

:scales: BubbleDeFi introduces liquid DEX trading by creating a sustainable way for community projects to trade on a decentralized market. All trades on BubbleSwap Dex are taxed for liquidity building.\
\
This will generate more liquidity and secure that liquidity perpetually by burning LP tokens. Providing a more expanding and efficient way of trading for all involved parties.

:ocean: Yield farming requires liquidity providers (LPs) and liquidity pools. To become an LP, all you have to do is to add your funds to a liquidity pool (smart contract). Once youâ€™ve locked up your funds in the pool, youâ€™ll get fees that have been generated from the underlying DeFi platform or reward tokens.\
\
:unlock: It can also be described as a merger between traditional banking services with blockchain technology. The number of LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the liquidity pool. You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity when the price is met. \
Users can provide liquidity to certain pools to earn tokens in return.&#x20;
