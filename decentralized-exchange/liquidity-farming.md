# ðŸ’§ Liquidity Farming

:scales: BubbleDeFi has revolutionized decentralized liquidity by introducing liquid DEX trading that enables community projects to trade on a decentralized market in a sustainable way.\
\
:construction\_site: All trades on BubbleSwap Dex are taxed to incentivize liquidity building, which in turn generates more liquidity and ensures perpetual security by burning LP tokens. This approach provides a more expanding and efficient way of trading for all parties involved.

:ocean: In the context of yield farming, liquidity providers (LPs) and liquidity pools play a vital role. Becoming an LP is simple and requires adding funds to a liquidity pool (smart contract), which generates fees from the underlying DeFi platform or reward tokens.

:unlock: This process can be seen as a merger between traditional banking services and blockchain technology. The number of LP tokens received by an LP represents their portion of the liquidity pool, and they can redeem their funds at any time by removing their liquidity when the price is met.Yield farming requires liquidity providers (LPs) and liquidity pools.

:moneybag: To become an LP, all you have to do is to add your funds to a liquidity pool (smart contract). Once youâ€™ve locked up your funds in the pool, youâ€™ll get fees that have been generated from the underlying DeFi platform or reward tokens.\
\
Providing liquidity to certain pools enables users to earn tokens in return, thereby encouraging active participation and engagement in the Bubble ecosystem\
