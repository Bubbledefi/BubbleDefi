# ðŸ§¬ Synthethic Yield Farming

:globe\_with\_meridians: The Bubble DeFi protocol allows users to stake their liquidity provider (LP) tokens and earn synthetic yield rewards. These rewards are based on a unique liquidity provider tax but are significantly higher when users lock their tokens for a certain period of time.

:moneybag: This makes synthetic yield farming a great way to earn passive income on the Bubble DeFi protocol. With synthetic yield farming, users can also leverage their rewards, meaning they can earn even more by investing a smaller amount of capital. This makes synthetic yield farming an attractive option for investors looking to maximize their profits.
