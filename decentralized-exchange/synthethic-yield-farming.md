# ðŸ§¬ Synthethic Yield Farming

:globe\_with\_meridians: Bubble DeFi's synthetic yield farming offers a lucrative opportunity for users to earn passive income by staking their liquidity provider (LP) tokens. The reward structure is based on a unique liquidity provider tax that offers substantial returns when tokens are locked for a specific period of time.

:farmer: Synthetic yield farming is a dynamic way for users to amplify their earnings as they have the flexibility to leverage their rewards. This means that users can earn more by investing a smaller amount of capital, creating an attractive option for those who seek to maximize their profits.
