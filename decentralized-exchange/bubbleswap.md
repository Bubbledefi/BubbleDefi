# ü§ù BubbleSwap

:heart: The BubbleSwap DEX is the heart of the Bubble ecosystem. It allows users to trade their ERC20 tokens in a trustless and secure way. Our protocol works by users providing liquidity to the different pools which can be used to trade different pairs in a censorship-resistant way.

:scissors: All trades that go through our automated pools are taxed with 1% to incentivize liquidity providing and reward their risk-taking.

:scales: While using BubbleSwap, you will have the option to choose your pairs and slippage tolerance for a more optimal trading experience.\
\
:construction\_worker: Limit orders and stop losses will be developed in our future upgrades and are a high priority in our roadmap.
