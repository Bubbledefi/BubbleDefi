# ðŸ‘¨ðŸŒ¾ Bubble Protocol Farming

:robot: The BubbleDeFi protocol is an automated market maker that provides users with the opportunity to stake their Bubble tokens and earn real yield in Bubble. This yield is 1:1 ratio of lp rewards collected by the protocol. \
\
:bulb: Unlike traditional staking where rewards are paid out in with a fixed APY creating great inflation for the token being staked, Bubble tokens staked on the protocol have a sustainable form of APY (sAPY) that is based on a real value which is generated through revenue by the protocol.
