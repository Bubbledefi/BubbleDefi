# ðŸ‘¨ðŸŒ¾ Bubble Protocol Farming

:robot:The Bubble DeFi protocol is an automated market maker that represents a novel approach to yield generation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. It provides users with a unique opportunity to stake their Bubble tokens and earn real yield in Bubble. This yield is proportional to the rewards collected by the protocol from liquidity providers (LPs), providing a 1:1 ratio of rewards for stakers.

\
:bulb:Unlike traditional staking where rewards are paid out with a fixed annual percentage yield (APY), creating an inflationary environment for the token being staked, Bubble tokens staked on the protocol have a sustainable form of APY (sAPY). This sAPY is based on a real value generated through the revenue generated by the protocol. This sustainable yield approach ensures that the token's value is preserved while also generating a reasonable return for investors.\
\
This innovative approach to yield generation allows users to take advantage of the high-growth potential of the DeFi space while minimizing the risks associated with traditional investment options. By participating in Bubble DeFi's staking program, investors can earn a passive income and contribute to the growth of the Bubble ecosystem.
